# tensorflow-playground
This is a replica of the online Tensorflow Playground project(http://playground.tensorflow.org/).

The original online version was using a tiny neural network library(https://github.com/tensorflow/playground/blob/master/src/nn.ts), but this project was written using Tensorflow. This project included the original functionalities, plus a few more features such as pause/restore, custimizable network size, and more data points patterns, etc.

The project was used for a year-long independent research, "Incremental Learning of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks". For more information, feel free to reach out to me.
